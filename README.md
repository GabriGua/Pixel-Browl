Remaking Brawl stars in 2D (kinda)
Live challenge of 24 Hours on my YT challenge. Yo I have PROOFS: [https://www.youtube.com/@SgabbsDev](https://www.youtube.com/@SgabbsDev)

### Let's get started

1. Use your mobile phone (Required for the best experience)
2. Go to the itch.io page [here](https://sgabbsdev.itch.io/pixel-browl)
3. Run the game
4. Use the joystick to move and shot
5. Be the last one alive!


## Why?
I make game dev videos.
One year ago, I made a video saying that I would have created Brawl Stars in just 1 day. I struggled to find time and motivation to do this. This month, I decided to make it real, but not just with a video, I did it in LIVE. A promise is a promise.

## Rules
- I can't use artificial intelligence

- I have 24 hours

- I can use video tutorials and online resources if necessary

- Achieve the best possible result

Pretty easy right? hell nah, go watch some pieces of my Lives and see how cooked I was.
